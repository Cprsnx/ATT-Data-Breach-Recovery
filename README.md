# ATT-Data-Breach-Recovery
Know how to secure your funds due to corporate data breaches
September 3, 2025

AT&T is yet another major corporation to fall victim to a massive customer data breach. Over 70 Million customers worldwide were put at risk when hackers were able to infilitrate AT&T servers and gather sensitive, private information that include, phone numbers, addresses, birthdates and even social securoty numbers. What is shocking to note is that AT&T has allowed this to happen multiple times. The first attack being in March 2024, attackers were able to successfully seize and market client information on the dark web for sale. Major companies across the globe, especially major celluar and internet providers pride themselves in having top of the line cyber security teams and secure protocols that prevent hackers from causing data infiltration. However, AT&T failed to address the threat on the data breach in March of 2024 and another attack on the company occured just a few months later in July of 2024. This attack exposed, not only the phone numbers, but all of the celluar data of all current and past AT&T consumers, this includes call logs, text messages, and online traffic from cellular data. AT&T's lack of attention to address the initial threat caused many of its consumers and their data to be exposed. The 2nd attack shows the both the negligence of customer privacy and the incomptence to bolster security for the sake of consumer privacy.

AT&T  relesead a statement at the end of March addressing the  first data breach claiming that the source of information involved is unknown to be from AT&T itself or one of its many vendors/partners. These vendors help AT&T run its operation. Global powerhouses such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google allow cloud hosting so that AT&T can run their services remotely across the world. They get their equiment from popular vendor: Cisco, the worldwide leader in networking solutions and physical hardware. Even if you are not a direct AT&T customer  companies like CoreSite, Digital Realty, Equinix, and others to host AT&T services to host customer information in their data centers. Customers who have their phone under smaller mobile companies that include US Mobile, Red Pocket, and Cricket Wireless were all potentially at risk of data information being stolen, misued and marketed for sale on the dark web. After an investigation by AT&T, they deemed the cause of the data breach was due to an illegal download on one of its partner 3rd party cloud platforms. Partnerships with companies that have vulnerabilities in security is not new in the world where major tech companies need to outsource their workload to willing up and coming vendors, unfortunately this can lead to problems like this- 

What can you do if you feel that you were involved? AT&T has recently reached a class action settlement in a lawsuit against them for all the clients who were put at risk in this incident. The lawsuit hearings landed a $177 Million dollar settlemeent for anyone who may have been involved in the attcaks. If you were a csustomer of AT&T or one of its partner companies, you are now eligible to file a claim and can recieve up to $7500. Last day to file a claim is on November 18.
